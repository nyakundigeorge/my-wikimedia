# Wikimedia Coding Test

## Task:
Develop a webpage with a form that allows a user to enter a Wikipedia article name and
choose the language version of Wikipedia. When the form is submitted, fetch the table of
contents of the article and display it in hierarchy. Clicking on an item in table of contents
takes the user to that section in the corresponding Wikipedia article â€“ in a new browser tab.
An example of the user interface is given below.
